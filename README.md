Predicting Parkinson’s disease using smartphone data

In this project, I compared the methods of SVM and Random Forest utilizing accelerometry, compass, and GPS data of predicting Parkinson’s disease. 

The results indicated that RF shows a better performance with 100% accuracy than SVM with just 87.5% accuracy. Altitude, longitude, and latitude are the three most significant features conducted by RF and Parkinson's group people show higher altitude values compared to the control group. However, the model which just includes the three most important features shows smaller 62.5% accuracy which may imply correlations between variables that needs to bee further explored.
